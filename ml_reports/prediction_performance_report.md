# Prediction Performance Report and System Verification

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**System Status:** ✅ Operational
**Focus:** Post-Merge Integrity Check & Performance Benchmark

## 1. System Integrity Verification
Following the report of a problematic merge in `optimized_ml_system.py`, a comprehensive verification was conducted.

- **Syntax & Import Check:** ✅ Passed
- **Dependency Check:** ✅ Passed (Fixed conflicting versions for `plotly`, `packaging`, `protobuf`, `rich`)
- **Training Pipeline:** ✅ Verified (Successfully trained ensemble on `BTC/USDT 15m`)
- **Feature Engineering:** ✅ Verified (Produced 95 features, selected top 50)
- **Model Saving:** ✅ Verified (Models, scalers, and selectors saved correctly)

**Conclusion:** The `optimized_ml_system.py` is fully functional and free of merge conflicts or critical errors.

## 2. Methodology ("Honest Benchmark")
To ensure reported performance is realistic, we employed an "Honest Benchmark" methodology:
- **Test Set:** Strictly the last 15% of historical data (chronologically).
- **Leakage Prevention:** Feature selection and scaling parameters were fitted ONLY on training data and applied to the test set.
- **Metric:** Direction Accuracy (Up/Down prediction).

## 3. Performance Results
**Target:** BTC/USDT (15m Timeframe)

| Metric | Result | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test Set Accuracy** | **52.18%** | ❌ FAKE / RANDOM |
| **Training Status** | Success | - |
| **Features Used** | 50 (Selected from 95) | - |
| **Sample Size** | 826 Test Samples | - |

**Analysis:**
The model achieved 52.18% accuracy on unseen test data. While technically functioning, this performance is close to random chance (50%) and significantly lower than potential training/validation scores. 
- **Intepretation:** The "FAKE" verdict indicates that while the model learns patterns in training, they do not strongly generalize to the most recent data (overfitting or regime change).
- **Comparison:** This aligns with the "Honest Benchmark" goal of exposing unrealistic expectations.

## 4. Recommendations
1. **Feature Engineering:** The current 95 features (reduced to 50) may not capture sufficient predictive signal for the 15m timeframe. Consider adding order book imbalance or on-chain metrics.
2. **Model Tuning:** Re-enable Optuna hyperparameter tuning (currently disabled in verification run) to potentially squeeze out more performance.
3. **Data Scope:** Train on a larger dataset (e.g., 6 months vs 2 months) to capture more market regimes.
